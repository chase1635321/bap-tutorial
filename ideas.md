# Ideas

 - Integrate the built in string-deobfuscator with radare2
 - Build radare2 graph of approximate decision flow (gives high level semantic information, ignoring CFG cases that are rarely taken)
 - Turn this into a gitbook
 - Section zero is installation; Section one is using bap from cli; section two is using bap as an extension from ocaml, python, c, rust; section three is writing plugins. Section on installation, contributing.
